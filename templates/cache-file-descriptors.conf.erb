# This tells Nginx to cache open file handles, "not found" errors, metadata about files and their permissions, etc.
# This means Nginx can imediatelly start serving the file; the downsize is that it may miss file changes. 
# In the below configuration, inactive files are released from the cache after 20 seconds, whereas
# active (recently requested) files are re-validated every 30 seconds.
# Descriptors will not be cached unless they are used at least 2 times within 20 seconds (the inactive time).
# A maximum of the 1000 most recently used file descriptors can be cached at any time.
